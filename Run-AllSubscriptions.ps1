# whose manifests were present (so a naive Get-Module -ListAvailable looked fine)

# In environments like Azure Cloud Shell the shell already has a valid az CLI
# and Az PowerShell session for the signed-in user. Unconditionally calling
# `az login` and `Connect-AzAccount` from the wrapper produces a redundant
# browser/device-code prompt every run.
#
# Two things have to be true to skip the interactive login:
#   1. The cached context for each side must be on the requested tenant.
#   2. That cached context must still be able to *acquire a token* silently.
# Condition 1 alone is not enough: a context can persist on disk (e.g. in
# ~/.Azure/AzureRmContext.json) with the right tenant ID but an expired or
# revoked refresh token. In that state Azure AD requires user interaction
# (typically driven by Conditional Access or MFA), so any data-plane call
# from inside the script will emit a warning like "Unable to acquire token
# for tenant ... User interaction is required" and silently return nothing -
# producing an empty inventory rather than failing loudly.
#
# Therefore the gate probes token acquisition for the requested tenant on both
# sides. Only if both probes succeed do we skip the login.

    # provided ScriptBlock in a fresh process). Process-level isolation is
    # what makes this safe: the inner script's `Set-AzContext -Subscription`
    # call (in the consumption phase) mutates *process-global* Az PowerShell
    # state, so two streams running in the same process would race each
    # other's contexts and silently cross-contaminate consumption data.
    # A separate process per stream sidesteps that entirely.
    #
    # Each stream owns:
    #   - Its own slice of the eligible subscription list (round-robin split).
    #   - Its own resume-state file at
    #     $InventoryRoot/.resume-state-<TenantID>-stream-<N>.json

    #   - Its own per-stream summary JSON (Stream_<N>_Summary.json) which the
    #     parent aggregates at the end.
    #   - Its own per-stream failures log (RunAllSubscriptions_failures_*_stream-<N>.log).

    #   - One Az context snapshot, written by the parent via Save-AzContext
    #     and imported by every stream via Import-AzContext. This is the only
    #     way to avoid an interactive sign-in prompt in each child process.
    #     The snapshot is removed after all streams finish.
    #
    # Output is interleaved (each stream prints its own lines, prefixed
    # `[stream-N]`). The final summary is consolidated from the per-stream
    # summary JSON files.

# Hard-fail with exit code 2 (distinct from auth/runtime exit code 1) if the
# number of per-subscription zip files written by this invocation is lower
# than the number of subscriptions that ran to completion this invocation.
#
# Why this matters. The consolidation step below globs `*.zip` under
# $InventoryRoot. If a per-sub zip is missing for any reason - antivirus
# quarantine, Cloud Shell ephemeral-storage eviction between worker exit and
# wrapper consolidation, a worker that crashed after the inner script logged
# completion but before its zip flushed, an out-of-disk-space write that the
# inner script silently swallowed - the wrapper would silently consolidate
# the smaller set and tell the operator everything succeeded. The downstream
# consumer then discovers an incomplete archive days later.
#
# Invariant. ResourceInventory.ps1 always writes a per-sub zip on a
# successful return, even when the sub holds zero resources (it still emits
# the empty-shape report). So:
#   expected zip count = number of subs in $SubResourceCounts
# (which is appended to ONLY on the inner script's successful return path,
# both in the sequential branch and after streaming aggregation).
# Failed subs (in $FailedSubscriptions) are intentionally NOT counted -
# their zip-or-no-zip state is unreliable and the wrapper already surfaces
# them via the failure summary.
