#Requires -Version 7.0

# Run-AllSubscriptions.Stream.ps1
#
# Worker script invoked by Run-AllSubscriptions.ps1 when -ParallelStreams > 1.
# Each instance of this worker:
#   - Runs as a separate `pwsh` background job (fresh process, fresh AppDomain).
#   - Owns its own slice of the subscription list.
#   - Owns its own resume-state file (.resume-state-<TenantID>-stream-<N>.json),
#     so the streams cannot race on a shared file.
#   - Imports an Az PowerShell context from a shared snapshot file written by
#     the parent wrapper, so authentication is not re-prompted per stream.
#   - Calls ResourceInventory.ps1 once per subscription in its slice.
#   - Emits structured progress lines to stdout (prefixed [stream-N]) so the
#     parent wrapper can collate output across streams.
#   - Writes a per-stream JSON summary at the end so the parent can aggregate
#     resource counts, consumption results, and failures into the final
#     wrapper-level summary.
#
# Start-Job runs this script block in a fresh runspace (separate process) where
# the parent's functions and variables are NOT in scope, so the wrapper passes
# everything via explicit parameters. Shared helper functions are dot-sourced
# below from this worker's OWN $PSScriptRoot (Functions/RunAllSubscriptions.Functions.ps1)
# - the same file the parent loads - rather than inherited from the parent.
