function Write-RdaProgress
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Single, reusable progress reporter used across the tool.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Renders progress so it is visible in every host the tool runs in:
          1. Write-Progress - a live updating bar in an INTERACTIVE host.
          2. A throttled host line - because Write-Progress is a NO-OP in the
             non-interactive hosts the tool frequently uses (parallel `pwsh`
             stream processes, ForEach-Object -Parallel runspaces, transcripts,
             CI). In those hosts a single line per call is written so progress is
             still visible / captured by a parent process or transcript.
          3. An optional durable heartbeat line appended to -HeartbeatLogFile so
             a long run is observable live and after the fact.

        The function is intentionally generic: it knows nothing about
        subscriptions, collectors or staging folders. Every caller does its own
        trivial index/total math and calls this. Two display modes:
          - Determinate  (-Total > 0): "<item> (<index> of <total>)" + a percent.
          - Count-only    (-Total omitted or 0): "<item> (<index>)", no percent,
            for loops whose total is not known up front.

    .PARAMETER Activity
        Task label shown as the progress activity (e.g. 'Processing
        subscriptions', 'Revealing per-subscription reports').

    .PARAMETER CurrentItem
        Short description of the item being processed now (subscription/collector/
        folder name). Callers may enrich it, e.g. 'Sub-Prod-40 (already revealed)'.

    .PARAMETER Index
        1-based position of the current item.

    .PARAMETER Total
        Total number of items. 0 (or omitted) selects count-only mode.

    .PARAMETER Id
        Optional Write-Progress -Id to distinguish nested/parallel bars (default 0).

    .PARAMETER HeartbeatLogFile
        Optional path. When supplied, a timestamped progress line is appended so
        progress is durable even where Write-Progress is a no-op. A write failure
        never throws (best-effort).

    .PARAMETER NonInteractiveLine
        Force emitting the plain-text host line regardless of host detection.
        Useful for child stream processes whose stdout a parent captures.

    .PARAMETER BarOnly
        Suppress the non-interactive plain-text line entirely - emit only the
        Write-Progress bar (plus the optional heartbeat log). Use for
        high-frequency loops that run in non-interactive child processes (e.g.
        the per-collector Service Processing loop, which runs inside a parallel
        stream worker), where one line per item would flood the parent's
        captured stdout. Mirrors the pre-existing Write-Progress-only behavior of
        those loops while still routing through this single function.

    .PARAMETER Completed
        Clears the Write-Progress bar for this -Activity/-Id (and logs a
        completion line when -HeartbeatLogFile is set). Use once after the loop.
